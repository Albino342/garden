          Hi there, 
        </h1>
        <p class="subtitle">
        welcome to my <strong><span class="has-text-success">garden</span></strong>!
        </p>
        <p> 
          A little while ago, I started doing one creative thing every day. I decided that it didn't have to be anything special so long as I was pushing myself creatively.
        </p><br />
        <p>
        Along the way, I realized something kind of profound: <strong>creativity is like weeding</strong>. You might get the occasional urge to go weed your garden (if you're that type of person) but nothing beautiful will ever grow in your garden if you rely wholly on these urges. Similarly, I realized that if I relied wholly on random urges to do creative work, I would never really cultivate anything beautiful.
        </p><br />
        <p>
        So, creativity is like weeding and the fruits of regular creative work are like a garden: some of the produce is weird, misshappen, ugly, pecked to death by birds, but some of it is beautiful and wonderful and it's all full of love. I hope you find something here that you love :) 
        </p><br />
